# Time App

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Python Flask application that returns the current time when visited at the `/time` endpoint. 
This screenshot demonstrates the successful result of accessing the application via the public IP and port (http://169.63.198.3:32602/time), validating that the application is running normally in the Kubernetes cluster and can return the current time. But I have closed this Kubernetes cluster due to ongoing charges, so it may not be possible to click on this page now.
